## Executive Summary
### Project Goal
The goal of this analysis was to provide the HR department with recommendations on how to decrease employee attrition.
### Key Findings
Ex-employees...
1. Reported lower job satisfaction than current employees.
2. Reported lower environemntal satisfaction than current employees.
4. Lived further from the workplace.
5. Had fewer stock options.
6. Worked a greater number of jobs prior to their position within IBM.
### Reccomendations
1. Survey employees to discover what it would take to increase their job satisfaction.
2. Survey employees to determine what changes can be made to the work environemnt in order to increase their environmental satisfaction.
3. Communicate with upper-manageemnt in order to formulate a travel plan that reduces the commute costs, or allow for remote work.
4. Provide stock options to more employees.
### Conclusion
Employee attrition can be decreased by bettering job and environemtnal satisfaction scores. Employees should also be provided with the means to easily commute to the workplace, or be allowed to work remotely from home. Finally, stock options should be offered to more employees to incentivize company loyalty.
### Call to Action
1. Create surveys to assess what would make employees more satisfied with their jobs and the workplace environment.
2. Create a plan with upper management to lessen costs of commuting, or allow for remote work.
3. Formulate a plan with finance department management pertaining to employee stock options.

### Porject Overview
This project utilizes employee attrition data, satisfaction scores, and other relevant data in order to determine the reasons why attrition within the IBM workplace occurs. This information is then used to provide recommendations on where stakeholders (HR) should focus in order to decrease the likelihood of attrition in the future.
### North Star KPIs -- HR Division, HR Management
1. Total Employees
2. Total Attrition
3. Attrition Rate
4. Retention Rate
### Key Questions
_1. What are the warning signs that attrition will occur?_

_2. What can be done to lower the chance of attrition?_
### Data Exploration
_For the purposes of this project, the data used was already cleaned, so there was no need to worry about data clenliness._
#### Satisfaction Scores
The first thing to look at were the "Job Satisfaction" and "Environmental Satisfaction" attributes. These columns contained scores given by employees within a questionare to determine their satisfaction pertaining to their jobs and the work environment. The visualizations for these scores were segmented via the "Job Role" and "Attrition" dimensions.

We see that, on average, the job satisfaction scores were lower for the employees that ended up leaving the company.
